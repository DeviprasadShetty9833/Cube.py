# Cube.py



# Overview

This is a simple and creative Python program that visually prints a 3D cube-like pattern in the console based on the number of sides (edge length) entered by the user.

The program dynamically adjusts the square’s size and intelligently carves diagonal layers from both corners to simulate a 3D optical illusion using only text characters (* and spaces). It’s great for improving logical thinking and mastering pattern-based programming.

# Key Features

1. Dynamic Cube Size
The user provides a number (between 2 and 15), and the program auto-adjusts the grid size and diagonal depth accordingly.


2. 3D Visual Effect
Smart use of asterisks and spaces creates an illusion of depth—mimicking a cube’s perspective.


3. Layered Carving Logic
The program removes stars diagonally from both the bottom-left and top-right corners, depending on the input size.


4. Clean & Readable Structure
Clearly commented and simple logic—perfect for beginners learning ASCII art or logic-based printing.
