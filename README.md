# Overview:

<br> This is a simple and creative Python program that visually prints a 3D cube-like pattern in the console based on the number of sides (edge length) entered by the user.
<br> The program dynamically adjusts the square’s size and intelligently carves diagonal layers from both corners to simulate a 3D optical illusion using only text characters (* and spaces). 
<br> It’s great for improving logical thinking and mastering pattern-based programming.
<br> 

# Key Features:

<br> 1. Dynamic Cube Size
<br> The user provides a number (between 2 and 15), and the program auto-adjusts the grid size and diagonal depth accordingly.
<br> 

<br> 2. 3D Visual Effect
<br> Smart use of asterisks and spaces creates an illusion of depth—mimicking a cube’s perspective.
<br> 

<br> 3. Layered Carving Logic
<br> The program removes stars diagonally from both the bottom-left and top-right corners, depending on the input size.
<br> 

<br> 4. Clean & Readable Structure
<br> Clearly commented and simple logic—perfect for beginners learning ASCII art or logic-based printing.
