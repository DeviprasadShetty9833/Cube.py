# Overview:

<br> This is a simple and creative Python program that visually prints a 3D cube-like pattern in the console based on the number of sides (edge length) entered by the user.
<br> The program dynamically adjusts the square‚Äôs size and intelligently carves diagonal layers from both corners to simulate a 3D optical illusion using only text characters (* and spaces). 
<br> It‚Äôs great for improving logical thinking and mastering pattern-based programming.
<br> 

# Key Features:

<br> ![1.](https://img.shields.io/badge/1.-Dynamic%20Cube%20Size-34A853?style=for-the-badge&labelColor=white)
<br> The user provides a number (between 2 and 15), and the program auto-adjusts the grid size and diagonal depth accordingly.
<br> 

<br> ![2.](https://img.shields.io/badge/2.-3D%20Visual%20Effect-34A853?style=for-the-badge&labelColor=white)
<br> Smart use of asterisks and spaces creates an illusion of depth‚Äîmimicking a cube‚Äôs perspective.
<br> 

<br> ![1.](https://img.shields.io/badge/3.-Layered%20Carving%20Logic-34A853?style=for-the-badge&labelColor=white)
<br> The program removes stars diagonally from both the bottom-left and top-right corners, depending on the input size.
<br> 
 
> üü¢‚Å† If the user inputs a *size n < 5*, then the pattern follows this transformation:
> - &nbsp; Initial Shape:
  A solid *(n + 1) √ó (n + 1)* square of * characters.
> - &nbsp; Diagonal Layer Transformation:
  The 1st diagonal layer from bottom-left to top-right will be partially carved i.e replaced by spaces (' '). All other positions will remain as *.


> ‚ä°‚Å† If the user inputs a *size n < 10*, then the pattern follows this transformation:
> - &nbsp; Initial Shape:
A solid *(n + 2) √ó (n + 2)* square of * characters.
> - &nbsp; Diagonal Layer Transformation:
The 1st & 2nd diagonal layer from bottom-left to top-right will be partially carved i.e replaced by spaces (' '). All other positions will remain as *.


> ‚ä°‚Å† If the user inputs a *size n < 15*, then the pattern follows this transformation:
> - &nbsp; Initial Shape:
A solid *(n + 3) √ó (n + 3)* square of * characters.
> - &nbsp; Diagonal Layer Transformation:
The 1st, 2nd & 3rd diagonal layer from bottom-left to top-right will be partially carved i.e replaced by spaces (' '). All other positions will remain as *.
