# Overview:

<br> This is a simple and creative Python program that visually prints a 3D cube-like pattern in the console based on the number of sides (edge length) entered by the user.
<br> The program dynamically adjusts the square‚Äôs size and intelligently carves diagonal layers from both corners to simulate a 3D optical illusion using only text characters (* and spaces). 
<br> It‚Äôs great for improving logical thinking and mastering pattern-based programming.
<br> 

# Key Features:

<br> 1. Dynamic Cube Size
<br> The user provides a number (between 2 and 15), and the program auto-adjusts the grid size and diagonal depth accordingly.
<br> 

<br> 2. 3D Visual Effect
<br> Smart use of asterisks and spaces creates an illusion of depth‚Äîmimicking a cube‚Äôs perspective.
<br> 

<br> 3. Layered Carving Logic
<br> The program removes stars diagonally from both the bottom-left and top-right corners, depending on the input size.
<br> 

‚ä°‚Å† If the user inputs a size n < 5, then the pattern follows this transformation:

1] Initial Shape:
A solid (n + 1) √ó (n + 1) square of * characters.

2] Diagonal Layer Transformation:
The 1st diagonal layer from bottom-left to top-right will be partially carved i.e replaced by spaces (' '). All other positions will remain as *.


‚ä°‚Å† If the user inputs a size n < 10, then the pattern follows this transformation:

1] Initial Shape:
A solid (n + 2) √ó (n + 2) square of * characters.

2] Diagonal Layer Transformation:
The 1st & 2nd diagonal layer from bottom-left to top-right will be partially carved i.e replaced by spaces (' '). All other positions will remain as *.


‚ä°‚Å† If the user inputs a size n < 15, then the pattern follows this transformation:

1] Initial Shape:
A solid (n + 3) √ó (n + 3) square of * characters.

2] Diagonal Layer Transformation:
The 1st, 2nd & 3rd diagonal layer from bottom-left to top-right will be partially carved i.e replaced by spaces (' '). All other positions will remain as *.


<br> 4. Clean & Readable Structure
<br> Clearly commented and simple logic‚Äîperfect for beginners learning ASCII art or logic-based printing.
